# Devarsh's Maths

This is a website that contains resources about maths. It uses Bun and SvelteKit. You can try it [here](https://maths.devarsh.me).

**Thanks to Hack Club Nest and Arcade for supporting this project!**

## How to develop

You need to have Bun installed on your computer. You can get Bun [here](https://bun.sh).

Then, run `bun install` to install dependencies, and `bun --bun run dev` to start the Vite development server.

Alternatively, you could use the `Dockerfile`.
