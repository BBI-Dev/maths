# Devarsh's Maths

This is a website that contains resources about maths. It uses Bun and SvelteKit.

## How to develop

You need to have Bun installed on your computer. If your device has [Nix](https://nixos.org), you can run `nix-shell` to get a shell with Bun installed. Otherwise, you can get Bun [here](https://bun.sh).

Then, run `bun install` to install dependencies, and `bun --bun run dev` to start the Vite development server.
